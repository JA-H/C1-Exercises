# C1 Exercises

This repository contains the four assignments completed in C++ for the C1 Scientific Computing module which I took during my MSc in Mathematics and Statistics. Some indication of the content of each of the assignments is provided.

## Assignment 1
A SparseMatrix class is implemented and used to invert a matrix using the Gauss-Seidel algorithm.

## Assignment 2
A class to implement a family of Runga-Kutta methods is created to solve and analyse numerically some 1D initial value problems. 

## Assignment 3
A vector-valued IVP is studied using the C++ library ODEINT.

## Assignment 4
This assignment consisted of 3 separate problems:
* Q1. Monte Carlo integration is studied.
* Q2. A solution of an ODE with uncertain parameters is calculated using Monte Carlo approximations.
* Q3. An advection-diffusion is studied using finite differences.
