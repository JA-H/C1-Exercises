# C1 Exercises

This repository contains the four assignments completed in C++ for the C1 Scientific Computing module which I submitted during my MSc in Mathematics and Statistics. Some indication of the content of each of the assignments is provided here whereas more detailed numerical analysis is provided in the report found in each of the directories.

## Assignment 1
A SparseMatrix class is implemented and used to invert a matrix using the Gauss-Seidel algorithm.

## Assignment 2
A class to implement a family of Runga-Kutta methods is created to solve and analyse numerically some 1D initial value problems. 

## Assignment 3
A vector-valued IVP is studied using the C++ library ODEINT.

## Assignment 4
This assignment consisted of 3 separate problems:
* Q1. Monte Carlo integration is examined.
* Q2. A solution to an ODE with uncertain parameters is calculated using Monte Carlo approximations.
* Q3. An advection-diffusion equation is studied using finite differences.
